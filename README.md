# jeraguilon.github.io

Source code for my personal website. I use React.js with some nifty plugins that generate static web pages
from the source.

### Commands
```
npm run start - start the service locally
npm run deploy - triggers the crawler to generate static web pages and deploys the build to
                 the master branch
```
