							<h4>Software Engineering Intern<br>
							Cloud Monitoring, Spring 2017</h4>
							<p class="project-text">As a member of cloud monitoring team, I improved usability of the analytics pipelines
							through a new pipeline monitoring service. This service aggregates the statuses of the pipelines and traces
							dependencies between the individual components. By storing pipeline statuses in a NewSQL database, I made
							complex tasks such as diagnosing the root cause of a cascading pipeline automatic. My entrance into this program
							was quite unique, as I got my interview after completing the Google Foobar challenge. Check out my portfolio for
							what that is!</p>
