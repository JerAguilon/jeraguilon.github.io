> Liked this? I also wrote about how I'd prioritize 
  [LeetCode and HackerRank questions](/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score).

Technical interviews are hard. There's a countless number of coding questions one can be asked.
However, I often see people brute force their way into knowing many questions by heart,
not realizing that most questions are actually asking the same things over and over. In reality,
most coding interview questions refer to just a few categories, just like behavioral questions.

Instead of offering many (seemingly) disparate questions, I presented 
visualizations of four algorithms to a campus org. I claim these algorithms cover _80%
of interview questions_. I also list well-known questions that fall into these 
categories. I've decided to publicly list my work.

Obviously, skimming a slideshow isn't enough to become great at interviewing,
so I encourage the ambitious or more experienced to look through my favorite resources
in the end.
