# Visualizing Four Key Interview Algorithms

> Liked this? I also wrote about how I'd prioritize 
  [LeetCode and HackerRank questions](/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score).

A few months back I presented to a campus org four algorithms that I think are crucial
to becoming an effective coding interview candidate. While there's an overwhelming
number of questions you can be asked, I've found that most of them refer to just a
small handful of algorithms and data structures. I'm listing four simple visualizations
that have been pretty important for my own successes.

Obviously, skimming a slideshow isn't enough to become great at interviewing,
so I encourage the ambitious or more experienced to look through my favorite resources
in the end.
