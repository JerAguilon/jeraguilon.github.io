# Ranking Interview Questions by Cram Score

#### _An opinionated list of SDE interview questions, organized by priority_

##### 3/11/18

Like many aspiring software devs, I've prepped for interviews using Leetcode and
HackerRank. While there is no shortage of questions, I find that they don't
address head-on what you should be studying. 

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) ranks based on difficulty,
which is a less useful metric when you simply want to target the most relevant questions.
Studying for a particular company? That feature is behind a paywall.
HackerRank's [Cracking the Coding Interview Course](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview)
comes close, but I found that the questions are mostly too rudimentary.


As somebody who [interns](/professional) quite often, I've been through many technical
interviews in the past few years. While it's not fair to share questions verbatim, the
questions I've picked prepare you awfully well for desirable companies.


Rather than organizing by topic or difficulty, I've organized these questions
based on what I'd study right before an interview. Level 1 questions are so common
that it pays to simply know these intimately. Level 3 questions
might show up less, but they're excellent for building a "6th sense" when answering
questions.

I still think there's a ton of value in the more verbose sources out there. But
if you're lost this is a good place to start.
