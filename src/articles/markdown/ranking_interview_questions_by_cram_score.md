Like many aspiring software devs, I've prepped for interviews using Leetcode and
HackerRank. While there is no shortage of questions, I find that they don't
address head-on what you should be studying. 

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) ranks based on difficulty,
but it's a suboptimal metric when you just want to study for an upcoming interview.
Studying for a particular company? That feature is behind a paywall.
HackerRank's [Cracking the Coding Interview Course](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview)
comes close, but I think the questions are mostly too rudimentary.


Rather than organizing by topic or difficulty, I've organized these questions
based on what I'd study before an interview. Level 1 concepts are so common
that understanding the solution will often help address variants you'll
see in an interview. On the other end Level 3 concepts may come up more
rarely, but they're nice to have in your back pocket.

I still think there's a ton of value in the more verbose sources out there. But
if you're lost this is a good place to start.

Also, If you're having trouble solving these, I highly recommend you look at
my [algorithm guide](/blog/a_collection_of_whiteboard_interview_templates), which
contains interactive code that can solve many of these questions.
