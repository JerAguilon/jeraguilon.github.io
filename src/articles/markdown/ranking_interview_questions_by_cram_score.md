Like many aspiring software devs, I've prepped for interviews using Leetcode and
HackerRank. While there is no shortage of questions, I find that they don't
address head-on what you should be studying. 

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) ranks based on difficulty,
but it's a pretty useless metric when you just want to prepare pragmatically.
Studying for a particular company? That feature is behind a paywall.
HackerRank's [Cracking the Coding Interview Course](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview)
comes close, but I think the questions are mostly too rudimentary.


As somebody who [interns](/professional) quite often, I've solved over 40 coding questions
for tech companies in the past two years. Although it's not fair to share questions verbatim, the
challenges I've picked prepare you awfully well for desirable companies.


Rather than organizing by topic or difficulty, I've organized these questions
based on what I'd study before an interview. Level 1 questions are so common
that it (literally) pays to know them. On the other end Level 3 questions
probably show up less, but they're excellent for building a "6th sense" when answering
problems.

I still think there's a ton of value in the more verbose sources out there. But
if you're lost this is a good place to start.

Also, If you're having trouble solving these, I highly recommend you look at
my [algorithm guide](/blog/a_collection_of_whiteboard_interview_templates), which
contains interactive code that can solve many of these questions.
