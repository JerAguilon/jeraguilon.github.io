# Ranking Interview Questions by Cram Score

#### _An opinionated list of SDE interview questions, organized by priority_

---

I made this tool because while there are plenty of compilations of questions,
I find that they don't address head-on what you should be studying. Leetcode,
for example, likes to rank based on difficulty, which is a less useful metric
when you simply want to target the most relevant questions.

Rather than ranking by difficulty or organizing by topic, I've instead categorized
by cram score and only included questions that I consider purely practical. Level 1
questions are so common, that it pays to simply know the solution. Level 3 questions
might show up less, but they're excellent for building a "6th sense" when answering
questions.

Before moving on, a disclaimer. There's a ton of variance in interview
difficulty, even within most companies. I and people I know have experienced
level 3 questions in first-round phone screenings. I and people I know have
also experienced level 1 questions every step of the way, even in inteview
pipelines of highly desirably companies.

I still think there's a ton of value in the more verbose sources out there. But
if you're lost this is a good place to start.
